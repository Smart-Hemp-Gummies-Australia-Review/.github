<p class="MsoNormal">What Are Smart Hemp Gummies?
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Smart Hemp Gummies are edible candies infused with hemp extract. Unlike CBD which can be extracted from both hemp and marijuana plants, hemp extract contains a spectrum of cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids peculiar to the hemp plant. These gummies are designed to offer the benefits of hemp in a delicious and easy-to-consume form, making wellness both accessible and enjoyable.
